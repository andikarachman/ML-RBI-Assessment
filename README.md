# ML-RBI-Assessment

This notebook describes the implementation of machine approach in the risk-based inspection (RBI) screening assessment, as described in the paper [*Machine learning approach for risk-based inspection screening assessment*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832018301662). This notebook is focused on the model development aspects of the paper. Some aspects, such as statistic test and comparative analysis of machine learning algorithm and human appraisers are excluded. Please refer to the paper for more explanation.

This is a research conducted as part of my PhD study in University of Stavanger.
